# FAQ

- Why not Calamares ?.

Calamares is awesome, but is an installer for Linux Distros only, Palas can install anything.

- Why not make it compatible with NimInst / InnoSetup ?.

InnoSetup is awesome, but is more oriented to embed files on the binary and then extract them from itself,
this is more flexible allowing you to install a whole Linux distro or just wallpapers on Windows,
this is not designed to not only embed stuff on itself but can produce a tiny binary that runs Bash or PowerShell,
from the base it works differently in a way that I can not glue with Palas (I tried tho).

- This runs on Windows ?.

Yes.

- This runs on Mac ?.

Yes.

- This runs on ARM and Raspberry Pi ?.

Yes.

- This runs on Alpine Linux ?.

Yes.

- This requires Nim installed ?.

No.
